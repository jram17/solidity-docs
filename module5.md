# 5. Control structures and Error handling
> Master Pok√©mon Logic ‚Äî Make Decisions, Avoid Critical Hits!

Your Pok√©mon knows its stats. It knows how to battle. But now it needs to make decisions in real time‚Äîshould it use Thunderbolt or heal? Should it attack, retreat, or evolve? That‚Äôs where control flow comes in.

Just like any good Trainer, your smart contract Pok√©mon must handle the unexpected: wild variables, edge cases, and logic errors. Solidity gives you the tools to build smart Pok√©mon that think, react, and protect themselves from bugs and bad actors.


This module covers Solidity‚Äôs core logic tools: **conditionals**, **loops**, **error handling**, and **modifiers.**all of which are critical to writing robust and secure contracts.

## Conditionals and Loops

### Conditionals

Used to make decisions based on boolean expressions.

```jsx
if (balance > 0) {
    // logic
} else {
    // alternative logic
}

```

### Loops

Used for iteration. Solidity provides `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

```jsx
// for loop example
for (uint i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    process(users[i]);
}

// while loop example
while (i < limit) {
    i++;
}

// Loops can be expensive in gas. Avoid unbounded loops in smart contracts.

```

## Error Handling - When Moves Fail
> A good Trainer always checks if a move is legal before using it. Maybe your Pok√©mon doesn't have enough HP, or the trainer isn‚Äôt authorized

Solidity provides three primary mechanisms for detecting and handling errors: `require`, `revert`, and `assert`.

**require( condition , message )**

-   Validates **inputs and external conditions**.
-   Reverts the transaction **with a message** if the condition is false.

```jsx
require(hp > 0, "Fainted Pok√©mon can't fight!");
require(msg.sender == trainer, "Not your Pok√©mon!");


```

**revert( message )**

-   Used to **explicitly revert** a transaction, often after complex logic.
-   More flexible than `require`, especially in nested conditions.

```jsx
if (isConfused && random() < 50) {
    revert("Pok√©mon hurt itself in confusion!");
}

```

**assert( condition )**

-   Used for **internal errors and invariants** that should never fail.
-   Consumes all remaining gas on failure.

```jsx
assert(totalCaught <= MAX_POKEMON);

```

> Prefer require for user input checks, revert for logic-based aborts, and assert for critical internal validations.

### Custom Error Definitions (Solidity 0.8+)

Custom errors are a gas-efficient alternative to revert strings. They allow for clearer and more structured error reporting.

```jsx
error NotYourPok√©mon(address caller, uint pokeId);

function release(uint pokeId) public {
    if (pok√©mon[pokeId].trainer != msg.sender) {
        revert NotYourPok√©mon(msg.sender, pokeId);
    }
    // release logic
}


// Custom errors save gas by avoiding long revert strings and provide typed error handling.

```

## Modifier Functions

Modifiers are reusable code blocks that run **before** (and optionally after) a function executes. They're commonly used for access control, validations, or pausing logic.

```jsx
modifier onlyTrainer(uint pokeId) {
    require(pok√©mon[pokeId].trainer == msg.sender, "Not your Pok√©mon!");
    _;
}

function evolve(uint pokeId) public onlyTrainer(pokeId) {
    // Evolution logic
}


```

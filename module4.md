# 4. Functions and visibility
> **Battle Functions Unlocked â€” Teach Your PokÃ©mon to Fight!**

Now that your PokÃ©mon has stats and identity, itâ€™s time to train it to **battle**. Functions are the **moves** your PokÃ©mon learns â€” they define how your smart contract behaves, how it responds to trainers (users), and how it interacts with other PokÃ©mon (contracts) in the Ethereum region.

Just like different PokÃ©mon have different move sets and strengths, Solidity functions have **visibility levels** and **modifiers** that control **who can use them**, **when**, and **how they interact** with the blockchain state or Ether.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective
-   Write reusable, well-scoped Solidity functions
-   Use visibility to control function access
 
-   Add behavioral modifiers like `view` , `pure` and `payable`
    
-   Hatch your PokÃ©mon with a constructor

## Function Definitions
A function in Solidity is declared using the `function` keyword, followed by a name, parameters, visibility, and optional modifiers.

```jsx
function moveName([parameters]) [visibility] [modifiers] returns ([returnType]) {
    // Move logic
}

```

```jsx
function tackle(address enemy, uint damage) public returns (bool) {
    // PokÃ©mon attacks another
    return true;
}
```

### Visibility Keywords - Who Can Use the Move?

Visibility determines **where** and **how** a function can be accessed. Just like some PokÃ©mon can only use certain moves in specific battles, function visibility controls where and who can call the function.

Solidity provides four visibility specifiers:
Visibility Keywords
| Visibility | Accessible From               | Use Case                          |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `public`   | Anywhere                      | External and internal calls       |
| `private`  | Inside the same contract      | Internal utility functions        |
| `internal` | This and derived contracts    | Inheritance-based internal logic  |
| `external` | Only from outside the contract| Public API interface              |

```jsx
contract Pikacode {
    function _zap() private { /* internal only */ }
    function thunderbolt() public { /* callable by users */ }
    function evolve() internal { /* shared by evolved forms */ }
    function trade() external { /* callable from outside only */ }
}


//Best practice: Minimize use of public where not needed to limit attack surface.

```

## Function Modifiers - Move Behavior Types
Function modifiers define how a function behaves with respect to the blockchain state and interaction with Ether.
| Modifier  | What It Means                             | PokÃ©mon Analogy                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `view`    | Reads state only (doesn't write)          | Scanning opponent's stats          |
| `pure`    | Does not read or write any contract state | Internal calculations like damage  |
| `payable` | Accepts Ether from Trainers               | A move that costs Ether to perform |

```jsx
function getHP() public view returns (uint) {
    return currentHP;
}

function calculateDamage(uint atk, uint def) public pure returns (uint) {
    return atk - def;
}

function evolveWithMoonStone() public payable {
    require(msg.value >= 1 ether, "Not enough Ether");
    // Trigger evolution
}

```

## Constructors
Every PokÃ©mon starts with a special moment â€” when it hatches and becomes part of your team. Thatâ€™s what a constructor does in Solidity!

**Constructors** run once, at deployment, and are used to assign initial values, like your PokÃ©monâ€™s trainer, origin story, or immutable traits.

-   Declared using the `constructor` keyword.
-   Cannot be called again after deployment.

```jsx
contract Charmantle {
    address public trainer;

    constructor() {
        trainer = msg.sender; // The first one to deploy becomes the Trainer
    }
}


// Use constructors to assign roles, initial values, or immutable variables at deployment.
```

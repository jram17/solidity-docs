# 10. Token Standards

> Welcome to the PokÃ©mon Token League!

You're now ready to unlock the blockchain equivalent of the PokÃ©mon worldâ€™s trading cards, currency, and item packs. This module explores how to bring PokÃ©Coins, Legendary PokÃ©mon, and booster packs to life using Ethereum's most powerful token standards:

- ERC-20: For fungible PokÃ©Coins and in-game currency
- ERC-721: For one-of-a-kind Legendary PokÃ©mon
- ERC-1155: For versatile PokÃ©Packs that contain items, characters, or both!

## ERC Token Standards Overview

Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) standards define how tokens behave. Solidity contracts follow these standards to ensure compatibility across wallets, marketplaces, and dApps.

| Standard | Type         | Use Case                         | Unique Feature                  |
| -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ERC-20   | Fungible     | PokÃ©Coins, currencies, XP points | Identical and divisible tokens  |
| ERC-721  | Non-fungible | Legendary PokÃ©mon, unique items  | Unique IDs for each token       |
| ERC-1155 | Multi-token  | Booster packs, hybrid items      | Batch operations & shared logic |




## ERC-20 â€“ PokÃ©Coins: Your In-Game Currency

ERC-20 tokens are like PokÃ©Coins in your walletâ€”every unit is equal and interchangeable.

**Key Functions:**

-   `totalSupply()` â€“ Total coins available
-   `balanceOf(address)` â€“ Trainerâ€™s PokÃ©Coin balance
-   `transfer(to, amount)` â€“ Send PokÃ©Coins
-   `approve() / transferFrom()` â€“ Allow others to spend on your behalf


``` jsx 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract PokeCoin is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("PokeCoin", "PKC") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}

```

> ERC-20 tokens are widely used in DeFi and represent currencies, staking tokens, or governance assets.

## **ERC-721 â€“ Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**

>  Legendary PokÃ©mon: Unique Collectibles

**ERC-721** tokens are perfect for Legendary PokÃ©monâ€”each with a distinct identity and metadata.
**ERC-721** defines the standard for **non-fungible tokens**â€”unique assets like digital art, collectibles, or in-game items.

**Key Functions:**

-   `ownerOf(tokenId)` - Who owns the PokÃ©mon
-   `safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId)` - Trade PokÃ©mon safely
-   `tokenURI(tokenId)` (metadata)

Each token has a unique ID and can point to metadata or artwork via IPFS or a centralized URL.


### Example: Legendary PokÃ©mon Contract

```jsx
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract LegendaryPokemon is ERC721 {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721("LegendaryPokemon", "LPM") {}

    function mintPokemon(address trainer) public returns (uint256) {
        _tokenIds.increment();
        uint256 newId = _tokenIds.current();
        _safeMint(trainer, newId);
        return newId;
    }
}


```

### **ERC-1155 â€“ PokÃ©Packs: Multiple Items, One Contract - Multi-Token Standard**

**ERC-1155** is ideal for booster packs that might contain a mix of itemsâ€”PokÃ©Balls, berries, even PokÃ©mon!

**Key Features:**

-   Batch minting/transfers (`safeBatchTransferFrom`)
-   Shared metadata for similar token types
-   Lower gas usage than ERC-721 for multiple tokens

### Example: PokÃ©Pack Contract

```jsx
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract PokePack is ERC1155, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC1155("https://api.example.com/metadata/{id}.json") {}

    function mintCard(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, id, amount, "");
    }

    function mintPack(address to, uint256[] memory ids, uint256[] memory amounts) public onlyOwner {
        _mintBatch(to, ids, amounts, "");
    }
}


```

> ðŸ’¡ **Use ERC-20** for fungible assets, **ERC-721** for one-of-a-kind items, and **ERC-1155** when dealing with large collections or hybrid assets.

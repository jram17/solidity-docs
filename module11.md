# 11. Bonus Module: Advanced Solidity Concepts

Youâ€™ve caught them allâ€”but can you protect them?

This final stage of your journey takes you deep into the security caves of Solidity and introduces you to evolutionary-level techniques like reentrancy protection, access control, and proxy-based upgradeability.

Welcome to the Elite Four of Smart Contract Developmentâ€”where each bug could be a critical hit if youâ€™re not prepared!



## Access Control â€“ Your Gym Badges

Youâ€™re up against gym leaders nowâ€”security is not optional.
Access control is how we make sure only qualified trainers (owners, admins, or roles) can use powerful movesâ€”like minting tokens, withdrawing funds, or updating contract logic.

Think of it as badges unlocking advanced features:

### `onlyOwner` using OpenZeppelin

Used for simple contracts where one trainer (the owner) holds all power:

```jsx
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract PokÃ©Vault is Ownable {
    function withdrawPokÃ©Coins() public onlyOwner {
        // Only the Champion can access the vault
    }
}


```

## The Custom Role Badge `(onlyAdmin)(msg.sender)`

For more granular control, you can define custom roles by comparing `msg.sender` to pre-set admin addresses:

```jsx
address public gymLeader;

constructor() {
    gymLeader = msg.sender;
}

modifier onlyLeader() {
    require(msg.sender == gymLeader, "Youâ€™re not a gym leader!");
    _;
}

function openBattleArena() public onlyLeader {
    // Only gym leaders can open the arena
}


```

>ðŸ’¡  For a full role system with multiple trainers, check out OpenZeppelinâ€™s AccessControl (great for large-scale leagues).


## Reentrancy - Defending Against Ghost-Type Attacks

### What is Reentrancy?

> Reentrancy is a **critical security vulnerability** where a malicious contract repeatedly calls a function **before the first invocation finishes**, often allowing unauthorized withdrawal of funds.

Itâ€™s like a ghost PokÃ©mon using Shadow Sneakâ€”attacking before you finish your move.

```jsx
function withdraw() public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] > 0);
    payable(msg.sender).call{value: balances[msg.sender]}("");
    balances[msg.sender] = 0; // oopsâ€”too late!
}

```

> The attacker can re-enter `withdraw()` before their balance is cleared.

### Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:

To prevent this, always update the state before making external calls to untrusted contracts

```jsx
function withdraw() public {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0);

    balances[msg.sender] = 0; // Effects first
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount); // Interaction last
}

```

## Upgradeability â€“ Mega Evolution for Contracts

Once a contract is deployed, itâ€™s like setting a PokÃ©monâ€™s natureâ€”it canâ€™t change.
But in real-world apps, you may need to patch bugs or add new features.

This is where proxies come in.
Think of them as evolution stonesâ€”upgrading your logic without changing the PokÃ©mon (contract address)!

## Proxy Pattern 

A **proxy contract** delegates calls to a **logic (implementation) contract**, while keeping the same address and state.
- Proxy = PokÃ©mon (holds experience, stats, and location)
- Logic Contract = Move Tutor (defines what it can do)
- Want to teach a new move? Just switch the Move Tutor.



**Common Proxy Types : **

-   **Transparent Proxy (OpenZeppelin)**: Clean separation between user and admin actions.
-   **UUPS Proxy**:  Lighter and more gas-efficient (like Quick Attack!).

> With OpenZeppelin Upgrades, you can deploy and upgrade contracts with safety checks and minimal hassle

**Basic Idea:**

-   Proxy holds state.
-   Logic contract holds code.
-   When you want to upgrade, deploy a new logic contract and point the proxy to it.


## ðŸ§­ Whatâ€™s Next?
Youâ€™ve mastered the code, the security, and the upgrade mechanics.
Your PokÃ©Deck is full, your contracts are armoredâ€”and your title of Solidity Champion is well-earned.

But this isnâ€™t the end.
True champions give back, build dApps, audit projects, and evolve the ecosystem.

Until next season:
Go beyond! Train harder. Code smarter. And deploy boldly.

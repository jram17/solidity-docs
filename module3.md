# 3. Data types and variables
> **Add Stats and Identity to Your Pok√©mon**

You‚Äôve summoned your smart Pok√©mon into existence with Solidity‚Äîbut a name isn‚Äôt enough. To battle in the Ethereum region, your Pok√©mon needs stats like HP, Type, and Power Level. It needs a Pok√©dex profile coded in Solidity‚Äôs data types.

In this module, you'll learn how to give your Pok√©mon its identity, abilities, and background data using Solidity‚Äôs value types, reference types, and variable scopes.

## üéØ Mission Objective
- Understand how to store and manage Pok√©mon data
- Learn value types, reference types, and variable scopes
- Discover constants and immutables for efficient stats

## Value Types
Value types are stored directly in memory and passed by value (i.e., copies are made). Solidity provides several built-in value types:

| Type      | Description                        | Example                          | Pok√©mon Use Case                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `uint`    | Unsigned integer (e.g., `uint256`) | `uint256 power = 25;`              | Set a Pok√©mon‚Äôs `hp`, `level`, or `attack power`.       |
| `int`     | Signed integer                     | `int256 temperature = -5;`       | Used for elemental Pok√©mon with cold or hot attacks.    |
| `bool`    | Boolean value (`true` or `false`)  | `bool isActive = true;`          | Track whether a Pok√©mon is in battle or fainted.        |
| `address` | Ethereum address (20-byte value)   | `address user = msg.sender;`     | Identify the Pok√©mon‚Äôs trainer (wallet address).        |
| `bytes32` | Fixed-size 32-byte array           | `bytes32 hash = keccak256(...);` | Store unique DNA hash or evolution IDs.                 |
| `string`  | UTF-8 encoded dynamic-length text  | `string name = "ditto";`         | Name your Pok√©mon, describe its type or evolution path. |


## Reference Types
Reference types store locations in memory or storage, not the actual data. They are more complex and require careful handling.
1.  Arrays
    
    -  Fixed or dynamic-size lists
        
        ```jsx
        uint[] public scores;
        string[] public moveSet = ["Ember", "Roar", "Tackle"];
        
        ```
        
2.  Mappings
    
    -  Key-value store; commonly used for efficient data lookup
        
        ```jsx
        mapping(address => uint) public xpEarned;
        
        ```
        
3.  Structs
    
    -  Custom data types that group related variables
        
        ```jsx
        struct Pokemon {
            string name;
            uint hp;
            string pokeType;
            bool isLegendary;
        }
        
        ```


## Variable scopes : Where Do Pok√©mon Store Their Memories?
Just like Pok√©mon remember moves differently during battle .In Solidity, variables exist in different **scopes**, which define how and where the data is stored and accessed during contract execution. Understanding these scopes is essential for writing efficient and secure smart contracts.

1.  State variable
    
    -   Declared **outside** functions.
    -   Stored **permanently on the blockchain** (in contract storage).
    -   Cost **gas** to read/write (except when accessed via `view` or `pure` functions).
    
    ```jsx
    string public species = "Charmander";; // state variable
    
    //Used to persist data across function calls and contract executions.
    
    ```
    
2.  Local variable
    
    -   Declared **inside functions**.
    -   Exist **temporarily during function execution**.
    -   Stored in **memory** or **stack**, depending on type.
    -   **Do not** cost gas unless interacting with storage or performing operations that consume gas.
    
    ```jsx
    function battleDamage(uint base, uint multiplier) public pure returns (uint) {
        uint result = base * multiplier;
        return result;
    }
    
    //Ideal for intermediate calculations or temporary values.
    
    ```
    
3.  Global variable
    
    -   Built-in variables provided by the **EVM context**.
    -   Accessible anywhere in the contract.
    -   Provide information about the blockchain, transaction, or message.
    
| Global Variable     | Description                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `msg.sender`        | Address that initiated the call          |
| `msg.value`         | Amount of Ether sent with the call       |
| `block.timestamp`   | Current block‚Äôs timestamp                |
| `block.number`      | Current block number                     |
| `tx.origin`         | Original external account initiator      |


## 	Constant and Immutables : Unchangeable Pok√©mon Laws
> Some Pok√©mon stats never change. Solidity gives you two options to lock values.

Solidity allows the declaration of variables whose values never change, which improves **readability**, **security**, and **gas efficiency**.

1.  Constant
    
    -   Must be assigned **at compile time**.
    -   Typically used for values that will never change (e.g., max limits, conversion rates).
    -   Stored directly in the byte-code ‚Üí **no storage cost**.
    
    ```jsx
    uint constant MAX_HP = 255;
    
    ```
    
2.  Immutable
    
    -   Assigned **once** during contract **deployment** (in the constructor).
    -   Useful for values that are dynamic at deployment (e.g., `owner`, configuration values).
    -   Stored in byte‚Äîcode like `constant`, but initialized at runtime.
    
    ```jsx
       address immutable creator;

    constructor() {
        creator = msg.sender;
    }
    
    ```

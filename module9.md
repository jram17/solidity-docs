# 9. Inheritance, Interfaces, and Libraries
> PokÃ©mon Families â€“ Sharing Traits Across Generations

As your PokÃ©mon world expands, youâ€™ll need to define types, shared abilities, and common behaviors across PokÃ©mon species. Think of inheritance as evolution paths, interfaces as battle protocols, and libraries as shared PokÃ©dex knowledge. This module helps you harness the power of modularity, code reuse, and standardized battle rules with Solidityâ€™s advanced programming constructs.


## Contract Inheritance
Just like how Pikachu and Raichu share electric powers, Solidity contracts can inherit abilities from their ancestors. Inheritance helps you organize code, reduce duplication, and evolve contracts over time.

```jsx
contract Pokemon {
    function typeOf() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Electric";
    }
}

contract Pikachu is Pokemon {
    // Pikachu inherits typeOf from Pokemon
}

```

**Key Benefits:**

-   Encourages modular contract design
-   Reduces code duplication
-   Enables access control patterns and reusable logic

## Using `abstract`, `virtual`, and `override`

Sometimes your base PokÃ©mon is incompleteâ€”like a fossil waiting to be revived. Use abstract contracts to define a blueprint, and virtual/override to customize behavior in derived PokÃ©mon

```jsx
abstract contract Creature {
    function speak() public virtual returns (string memory);
}

contract Psyduck is Creature {
    function speak() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "Psy-ai-ai!";
    }
}

```

> Abstract = Blueprint PokÃ©mon

> Virtual = "This move can evolve."

> Override = "Iâ€™ve evolved this move."



## Interfaces in Solidity
Interfaces act like battle protocols: every PokÃ©mon that wants to fight in a league must implement the right moves. They donâ€™t define how the moves workâ€”just that they must exist.


### Key Rules:

-   Only function declarations allowed (no logic)
-   All functions must be `external`
-   Cannot declare state variables

```jsx
interface IBattleReady {
    function attack(address target) external;
    function defend() external returns (bool);
}


```

Interfaces allow contracts to **communicate across systems** while adhering to predefined standardsâ€”critical in DeFi and token ecosystems.

### Libraries and OpenZeppelin

Libraries are non-deployable contracts packed with reusable moves. Use them to teach all your PokÃ©mon utility logic like calculating damage or managing cooldowns.

### Example : Utility Library
```jsx
library DamageCalculator {
    function calculate(uint base, uint multiplier) internal pure returns (uint) {
        return base * multiplier;
    }
}

```

```jsx
import "./DamageCalculator.sol";

contract Battle {
    using DamageCalculator for uint;

    function strike(uint base, uint power) public pure returns (uint) {
        return base.calculate(power); // uses library logic
    }
}

```

## OpenZeppelin - Trusted PokÃ©mon Professor Tools 

OpenZeppelin is like Professor Oakâ€™s labâ€”packed with tools and wisdom for smart trainers.

OpenZeppelin provides a widely-used, audited set of contracts and libraries for:

-   Access control (`Ownable`, `AccessControl`)
-   Tokens (`ERC20`, `ERC721` , `ERC1155`)
-   Utilities (`SafeMath`, `Counters`, `ReentrancyGuard`)

### Benefits:

-   Security-reviewed code
-   Standard implementations (e.g., ERCs)
-   Easy integration with tools like Hardhat and Foundry

Example

```jsx
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract PokÃ©Vault is Ownable {
    function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
        // only Ash can withdraw rare candies
    }
}

```
